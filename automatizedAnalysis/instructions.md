If using analysis code for backgrounds post WW, skip step 2 and download all the root files for said backgrounds in same folders as the first 4.




Instructions to run the whole automatized analyisis:
   1) Setting up the environment:

1.1) All of these files are in girhub.com/santiago-ampudia/XCC_gammagamma_HH_bbbb, in the branch "automatizedAnalysisAfterqqttbarZZWW".

  1.2) In the main delphes folder, create a folder called "analysis".
  
  1.3) In the analysis folder, create a folder called "FilesPostDelphes". In that folder, download from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J3-QTyudBDuOUP8xE-UI6KjnA1BFSu4H?usp=drive_link the following files (conserve the names):
  
    1.3.1) GammaGammaHHESpreadAll.root (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RYew-EAp7osoZN1_TDRtElfalj0ktf4W/view?usp=drive_link)
    
    1.3.2) GammaGammabbbbqqESpreadAll.root (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Itd33G35XDI5zQxDRCihQEDOuea-a7wb/view?usp=drive_link)
    
    1.3.3) GammaGammattAll.root (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sgGuIcBX_9xLRiCRS6HF2gT5Ae1IWh-T/view?usp=drive_link)
    
    1.3.4) GammaGammaZZESpreadAll.root (https://drive.google.com/file/d/13L4Ahgb8dTT4okx2W5KHMd1_T2NXC8T7/view?usp=drive_link)
    
    1.3.5) GammaGammaWWESpreadAll.root (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x6FT7avVS4VxrHtToImq2Jf7CJbYl5FZ/view?usp=drive_link)
    
  1.4) In the analysis folder, create a folder called "SampleOG" and download there the files post-initial preselection used for benchmark significance; found in automatizedAnalysis/TMVA/postPreselectionTrainingAndTestingFiles (link to drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mVbKmLJLOGIIjmmfpWWev66vmpt5V6Zu?usp=drive_link); conserve the names of the files
  
  1.5) In the analysis folder, create a folder called "SampleOGNNOfNNs" and download there the files for NNofNNs training and testing; files found in automatizedAnalysis/TMVA/filesForTrainignAndTestingNNOfNNs (link to drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TplUy9B_DsVpDBlkfLFu29ZGILggFN_B?usp=sharing); conserve the names.
  
  1.6) In the main delphes folder, download FSRWholeClassification.C, found in automatizedAnalysis.
  
  1.7) In the analysis folder, download FSRGammaGammaHHbbbbAnalysis.C,found in automatizedAnalysis/analysis.
  
  1.8) In the analysis folder, download the following files found in automatizedAnalysis/TMVA:
  
    1.8.1) FSRTMVAClassificationHHbbbb.C (https://github.com/santiago-ampudia/XCC_gammagamma_HH_bbbb/blob/automatizedAnalysisAfterqqttbarZZWW/automatizedAnalysis/TMVA/FSRTMVAClassificationHHbbbb.C)
    
    1.8.2) FSRTMVAClassificationApplicationHHbbbbGeneratesNNs.C (https://github.com/santiago-ampudia/XCC_gammagamma_HH_bbbb/blob/automatizedAnalysisAfterqqttbarZZWW/automatizedAnalysis/TMVA/FSRTMVAClassificationApplicationHHbbbbGeneratesNNs.C)
    
    1.8.3) FSRTMVAClassificationOutputNN.C (https://github.com/santiago-ampudia/XCC_gammagamma_HH_bbbb/blob/automatizedAnalysisAfterqqttbarZZWW/automatizedAnalysis/TMVA/FSRTMVAClassificationOutputNN.C)
    
    1.8.4) FSRTMVAClassificationApplicationOutputNN.C (https://github.com/santiago-ampudia/XCC_gammagamma_HH_bbbb/blob/automatizedAnalysisAfterqqttbarZZWW/automatizedAnalysis/TMVA/FSRTMVAClassificationApplicationOutputNN.C)
    

2) Replicating result and confirming proper set up:
   
  2.1) In FSRGammaGammaHHbbbbAnalysis.C, change in line 3935, "string fileFunction = "generate";" for "string fileFunction = "merge";"
  
  2.2) cd into the main delphes folder and run "root -l -b -q FSRWholeClassification.C'( "merge", "34BSplit", "All4V", 1)' "
  
    2.2.1) First argument indicates that we are using the same sampling as the one used for the benchmark result (alternatively, we could use "generate" instead of "merge" for new sampling; use "merge" to replicate result).
    
    2.2.2) Second argument indicates the preselection ("34BSplit" means that we are accepting events with 4b jets or 3b 1 non-b jets, and splitting the data for training and testing 75%-25%).
    
    2.2.3) Third argument indicates the batch of variables used (check file in variablesNN/variablesVersionDescription.odt for the different batches of variables (link: https://github.com/santiago-ampudia/XCC_gammagamma_HH_bbbb/blob/automatizedAnalysisAfterqqttbarZZWW/variablesNN/variablesVersionDescription.odt))
    
    2.2.4) Fourth argument is how many trials (samples) you want for the analysis stats. To replicate a result, just run it once.
    
  2.3) Compare results (for benchmark result, these are the stats: 
  
      preliminarySignificance: 5.84281
      
      significance: 7.2256
      
      For 1 samples: 
      
      meanPreliminarySignificances: 5.84281
      
      meanSignificances: 7.2256
      
      meanErrorsLeft: 0.135458
      
      meanErrorsRight: 0.141374
      
      sample that generates the best final significance: 0)


3) Getting new sampling-independent statistics:

  3.1) In the analysis folder, delete the files generated by the previous analysisis (i.e. outputTreeSHHbbbbESpreadDurham1034BSplitTrainSample0.root, ..., outputTreeBWWHHbbbbESpreadDurham1034BSplitTestSample0.root, as well as outputTreeSNNESpreadDurham1034BSplitTrainSample0.root, ..., outputTreeBWWNNESpreadDurham1034BSplitTestSample0.root)
  
  3.2) In FSRGammaGammaHHbbbbAnalysis.C, change in line 3907, "string fileFunction = "merge";" for "string fileFunction = "generate";"
  
  3.3) cd into the main delphes folder and run "root -l -b -q FSRWholeClassification.C'( "generate", "34BSplit", "All4V", 50)'  " or "root -l -b -q FSRWholeClassification.C'( "generate", "34BSplit", "All5V", 50)'  ". All5V eliminates the three variables from 4V with the worst performance for each back, so less computationally heavy. 
  
  3.4) get the results and save them, as well as the files associated to the sample with the highest significance.


**4) Get groundbreaking results and save physics and the future of academia.**
