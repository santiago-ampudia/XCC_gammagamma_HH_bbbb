TMVAClassificationHHbbbb.C is the Code that does the training of all the neural networks and then TMVAClassificationApplicationHHbbbb.C is the code for the implementation (Application). TMVAClassificationApplicationHHbbbb.C also implements the rest of the analysis, finishing with the cross-section calculation, sensitivity, and significance. 

This folder also contains the files with the vars. generated by the preselection and used for the NN.


These versions are up to the implementation of the first four backgrounds (HH vs qq, ttbar, ZZ, WW) and considerates vars up to version 4 (see main/variables/NN for the versions).
