Code that does the preselection of events and generates files with trees with the variables used for the training and testing of the neural networks.

This version is up to the implementation of the first four backgrounds (HH vs qq, ttbar, ZZ, WW) and generates the output trees with vars up to version 4 (see main/variables/NN for the versions).
